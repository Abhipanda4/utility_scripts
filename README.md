# Utility Scripts

This repo contains some python and bash scripts, written mainly for improving functionality or just for some amusement.

It contains the following scripts:
### History Analyzer
#### Language: python

This is a simple script to show your most visited sites by analyzing your browsing history. It gathers data from Firefix and Google-Chrome browser, although it can be easily extended to other browsers as well.

#### Note:
This does not show any sites visited in incognito mode since they are not stored in history. So relax and use it freely :p


### Youtube Video Downloader
#### Language: python
Built it for opening a website with the direct link for downloading youtube videos. No need to copy paste individual URLs. Manual intervention needed to start download.
