This is a simple script to show your most visited sites by analyzing your browsing history. It gathers data from Firefix and Google-Chrome browser, although it can be easily extended to other browsers as well.

#### Note:
This does not show any sites visited in incognito mode since they are not stored in history. So relax and use it freely :p
